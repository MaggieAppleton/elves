# Elves

A local-first, canvas-based writing studio for taking a piece from scattered notes to a shaped set of your-own-voice points. You think spatially on an infinite canvas of cards; the tool keeps everything on your machine in a plain, human-readable file.

> **Status: Phase 3b (Claude transcribes images).** Create, edit, arrange, and persist cards; drop in **images** (photos of paper notes, sketches) as source cards; and work with Claude, who comments / dedupes / reorders and now **transcribes handwritten notes** into text source cards — all within a hard boundary (never writing your prose), everything natively undoable. Tana import and MDX are later — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

## What it does (Phase 1)

- An infinite [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev) canvas with two kinds of **card**:
  - **Prose cards** — your own words (a point, a sentence, a paragraph), shown in your chosen typeface.
  - **Source cards** — raw reference material, shown muted with an origin badge.
- Create cards from a toolbar, drag to arrange, and **double-click to edit** text inline.
- Everything autosaves to a local `data/canvas.json` and **survives reload**.

## What it does (Phase 2a — the Claude-ready canvas)

The canvas receives **change-sets** — the mechanism Claude drives in Phase 2b — applied live and undoably. Phase 2a built and proved this machinery on its own; Phase 2b (below) connects Claude to it:

- **Comments** on any card: color-coded by type (`needs-evidence` · `weak-argument` · `needs-citation`) or freeform, each resolvable (resolve → hidden, kept).
- **Merge** duplicate source cards: they collapse under a representative (hidden, recoverable) with a "N merged" badge.
- **Move / reorder**: cards reposition along the left→right narrative axis (left = earlier, right = later).
- Each change-set applies as **one Ctrl-Z-undoable** step and persists.

A change-set is `POST`ed to the server's `/changeset` endpoint and broadcast over a websocket (same port, `5199`) to the open app. **The boundary:** Claude's operations never write or edit your **prose** — they comment, merge, move, and (as of Phase 3b) create *source* cards from transcribed handwriting. Your prose stays yours, structurally.

## Using Claude (Phase 2b)

With the app running (`npm run dev:all`), Claude reaches the canvas through a scoped
MCP server. In Claude Code, opening this project offers the `elves` MCP server
(see `.mcp.json`); approve it. Then ask Claude things like "read my canvas and flag
weak spots", "dedupe my source cards", or "reorder these points for flow". Claude's
changes appear live and are undoable.

Claude has exactly five tools — `read_canvas`, `add_comment`, `merge_sources`,
`move_cards`, and `create_source_card` (transcribe an image, Phase 3b). There is
deliberately no tool to write or edit your **prose**: Claude comments, dedupes,
reorders, and transcribes into *source* cards, but never writes your prose. See
`skill/elves-canvas.md`.

## Images (Phase 3a)

Drag an image onto the canvas — or use the **+ Image** button — to add it as an
**image source card**: a photo of paper notes, a Procreate/iPad sketch, or any
picture that supports a nearby point. Image cards drag and resize like any card.

Images are stored **local-first as files** in `data/assets/`; `canvas.json` keeps
only a small `assetId`, so your canvas stays a portable folder no matter how many
sketches you add. Ask Claude to **transcribe** a handwritten-notes image and it types
your handwriting into a text source card next to it (Phase 3b, below).

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (developed on Node 23) and **npm**.
- macOS/Linux/Windows. A modern browser for the app.

## Setup

```bash
# from the project root
npm install
```

For the end-to-end tests only, install the Playwright browser once:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Running the app

Elves is two local processes: a small **server** that owns the canvas file, and the **web app**. Run both together:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173**.

- The app runs on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite).
- The canvas server runs on `http://localhost:5199` and reads/writes `data/canvas.json`.

Prefer separate terminals? Run them independently:

```bash
npm run server   # canvas server on :5199 (watch mode)
npm run dev       # web app on :5173
```

> A small tldraw watermark appears in the corner — that's the free tier and is fine for personal use.

## Using it

- **+ Prose** / **+ Source** in the toolbar add a card at the centre of the view.
- **+ Image** (or drag an image file onto the canvas) adds an image source card.
- **Drag** cards to arrange them; use the canvas to group and lay out your argument spatially. Drag a card's corner to **resize** it.
- **Double-click** a card to edit its text; click empty canvas to commit.
- Edits save automatically (debounced) to `data/canvas.json`.

## Configuration

Set via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ELVES_CANVAS` | `data/canvas.json` (relative to `server/`) | Path to the canvas file — **one file per piece**. |
| `PORT` | `5199` | Port for the canvas server. |
| `VITE_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:5199` | Where the web app looks for the server. |

Example — work on a different piece:

```bash
ELVES_CANVAS=./pieces/my-essay.json npm run server
```

## Scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev:all` | Run the server and web app together (usual dev command). |
| `npm run dev` | Web app only (Vite, `:5173`). |
| `npm run server` | Canvas server only, watch mode (`:5199`). |
| `npm run start` | Canvas server once (no watch). |
| `npm run build` | Production build of the web app. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build. |
| `npm test` | Run the unit test suite (Vitest). |
| `npm run test:watch` | Unit tests in watch mode. |
| `npm run e2e` | Run the Playwright end-to-end tests. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check with `tsc --noEmit`. |

## Testing

```bash
npm test           # unit tests (model, store, server, client)
npm run typecheck  # strict TypeScript check
npm run e2e        # end-to-end (needs: npx playwright install chromium)
```

The e2e suite runs its own server against a throwaway `.e2e/canvas.json`, so it won't touch your real canvas.

```

## Data & privacy

Local-first by design. Your canvas is a plain, human-readable JSON file (`data/canvas.json`) and your images are plain files (`data/assets/`), all on your machine and git-ignored. Nothing is sent anywhere.

## Design principle

Your writing stays yours. The data model separates **source** (reference) cards from **prose** (your words), and the codebase enforces — structurally — that only a human, editing in the app, can write a card's prose text. As of Phase 2a this holds even for automated change-sets: the operations they may contain (comment, merge, move) structurally cannot write a card's text. Claude helps organize and critique, but never writes your prose.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 2a — Claude-ready canvas (done):** change-sets for comments, merge, and reorder, applied live and undoably.
- **Phase 2b — Claude connected (done):** a scoped MCP server exposing the change-set operations + a Claude skill, so Claude reads the canvas and comments / dedupes / reorders within the boundary.
- **Phase 3a — images on the canvas (done):** drag-in / **+ Image** source cards, stored as local files.
- **Phase 3b — transcription (done):** Claude reads a handwritten-notes image and transcribes it into a text source card (your words), via a `create_source_card` tool — still never writing your prose.
- **Later:** assisted Tana import, MDX export, multi-device.
